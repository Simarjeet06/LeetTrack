💻 Setup Instructions



Clone the Repository
-git clone https://github.com/Simarjeet06/LeetTrack.git


🔐 LeetCode Integration Note
Due to LeetCode’s lack of public API, the app currently uses GraphQL endpoints. If those fail due to server-side issues, fallback scraping can be integrated as a future enhancement.

##📌 Future Improvements

-Push notifications for daily challenge reminders
-Offline data caching
-User authentication and personalization
